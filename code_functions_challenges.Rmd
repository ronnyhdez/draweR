```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Quick notes about short R code and functions things that usually I don't do
and I tend to forget.

## Change specific values in all columns for NA's

A data frame with `-9999` values in many columns that need to be replace with
`NA`'s values:
```{r}
# libraries
library(dplyr)

# Test data frame
test <- tribble(~a, ~b, ~c,
                "a", 2, -9999,
                "b", 3, 5,
                "c", -9999, 6,
                "d", -9999, -9999)

# Solution
test %>% 
  mutate_all(~na_if(., -9999))
```
