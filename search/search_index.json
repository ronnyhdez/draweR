Be aware that this is not an organized place. It's just a place where I put all my R notes to look for after. If something works for you as a reference, great! Take it! Before this, all this notes where kept in my desk drawer What you can find here: Things with strings Wondering how to ask yes and no questions in R? How this site was built? This site is hosted in GitHub. I just created the repo, went to configuration and enabled github pages. Then, with a bit of help of mkdocs and the material theme the site came to life. And now all my Rmarkdown notes fits in this site! Also, I was kind of \"obstinado\" having to repeat a couple of steps for each note that I wanted to deploy, so I created some R functions (around 3) to deal with this workflow and put everything together in a small R package that I called docmaker (Available just on GitHub) If you are new to this kind of documentation, I recommend you to check at least the package documentation, so you can find how to set-up everything to create your own site and give some freedom to your documentation. Who am I? I'm a desk biologist who likes to play around with my computer.","title":"Drawer: Where I keep my R notes (and other dev stuff)"},{"location":"#drawer-where-i-keep-my-r-notes-and-other-dev-stuff","text":"Hi!
