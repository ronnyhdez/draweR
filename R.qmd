# Include ifelse within a pipeline


In case we are working in a data pipeline, but in the middle we need to
include a condiciontal statement, we can do it in the following way:


```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)

status <- "most liked"

iris %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  {if (status == "most liked") {
    filter(., species == "setosa")
  } else {
    filter(., species %in% c("versicolor", "virginica") )
  }} %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  tally()
```
