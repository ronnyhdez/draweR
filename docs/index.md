# Drawer: Where I keep my R notes (and other dev stuff)

Hi! Be aware that this is not an organized place. It's just a place where
I put all my R notes to look for after.

If something works for you as a reference, great! Take it! Before this, all
this notes where kept in my desk **drawer**

## What you can find here:

- [Things with strings](https://ronnyhdez.github.io/drawer/stringr_tips/)
<!-- ![A weird foor loop]() -->
 - [Wondering how to ask yes and no questions in R?](https://ronnyhdez.github.io/drawer/questions_in_r/)
<!-- ![Things that never stick in my head: map]() -->

## How this site was built?

This site is hosted in GitHub. I just created the repo, went to configuration 
and enabled github pages.

Then, with a bit of help of [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the
[material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) the site 
came to life.

And now all my [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) notes fits in this site! 

Also, I was kind of ["obstinado"](https://www.linguee.com/english-spanish/search?source=spanish&query=obstinado) having to repeat a couple of steps for
each note that I wanted to deploy, so I created some R functions (around 3)
to deal with this workflow and put everything together in a small R package
that I called [docmaker](https://github.com/ronnyhdez/docmaker) (Available
just on GitHub)

If you are new to this kind of documentation, I recommend you to check
at least the package documentation, so you can find how to set-up
everything to create your own site and give some freedom to your documentation.

## Who am I?

I'm a [desk biologist](http://ronnyhdez.rbind.io/) who likes to play 
around with my computer.
