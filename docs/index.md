# Welcome!

Hi! I'm [ronny](https://ronnyale.com/) and this site is my digital drawer made 
public. This means that you will find here **raw notes** that I usually take 
when I working with data and I have the need to document the process I'm following.

Be aware that this is not an organized place. It's just a place where
I put all my R notes to look for after (in case my future self forgets what I
did in the past). If you want to check a place with tutorials and edited notes
you can go and check my [blog](https://ronnyhdez.github.io/blog/). It's in
spanglish (some posts in Spanish, others in English and maybe some of them
with a mix) and I usually source part of the material from here.

If something works for you as a reference, great! Take it! Before this, all
this notes where kept in my desk **drawer**

## What you can find here

 - On your **left side** you will see the main table of contents
 - On your **right side** you will see the table of contents from the specific 
 section you are in.

## How this site was built?

This site is hosted in GitHub. I just created the repo, went to configuration 
and enabled github pages. Then, with a bit of help of [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
and the [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) the site 
came to life.

And now all my [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) notes fits in this site! 

Also, I was kind of ["obstinado"](https://www.linguee.com/english-spanish/search?source=spanish&query=obstinado) having to repeat a couple of steps for
each note that I wanted to deploy, so I created some R functions (around 3)
to deal with this workflow and put everything together in a small R package
that I called [docmaker](https://github.com/ronnyhdez/docmaker) (Available
just on GitHub)

If you are new to this kind of documentation, I recommend you to check
at least the package documentation, so you can find how to set-up
everything to create your own site and give some freedom to your documentation.

## Who I am?

I'm a [desk biologist](http://ronnyhdez.rbind.io/) who likes to play 
around with my computer, specially with R, Linux, Vim and a couple of other tools.
